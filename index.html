      <p><i><h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2></i></p>
      <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br> industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br> text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br> of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br> survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br> typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br> the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br> Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br> software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

      <p><h2><i>Where does it come from?</i></h2></p>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br> making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br> professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of <br> the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum <br> passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical <br> literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum <br> comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum <br> et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in  <br> 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br> during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem <br> Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

      <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is <br> reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and <br> 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also <br> reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English <br> versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

    <p><h2><i>Why do we use it?</i></h2></p>
   
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the <br> readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of <br> using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution <br> of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', <br> making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing <br> packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their <br> default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover <br> many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved <br> over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <br> (injected humour and the like).</p>

    <p><h2><i>Where can I get some?</i></h2></p>

    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, <br> but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected <br> humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly <br>  believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you <br> need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the <br> middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet <br> tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the <br> first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 <br> atin words, combined with a handful of model sentence <br> structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The <br> generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, <br> injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
